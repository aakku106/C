        where offset = no. of position (bytes) to be moved from the location specified by position.
position
    0       begening of file
    1       curr position
    2       end of file


fseek(fp,0L,0);   moves curser to beginning of file equivalent to rewind(fp)
fseek(fp,0L,1);   curser remains in current position.
fseek(fp,0L,2);   moves curser to end of file .
fseek(fp,m,0);    Move (m+1) byte in file.
fseek(fp,m,1);    Go forward by m byte.
fseek(fp,-m,1);   Go backward by m byte from current position.
fseek(fp,-m,2); Go backward by m byte from end of the file.
